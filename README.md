## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my github profile! My name is emi (She/They). I am just a silly trans girl, currently studying engineering. I am passionate about programming, math and astronomy :3

My favourite and most commonly used language currently is C#, but i also like Go and Rust. I am interested in machine learning, optimization problems and other computer science stuff <3
